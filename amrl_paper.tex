\begin{abstract}

The ability to determine the location of a robot in its environment is a key requirement of autonomous robotics tasks. The particle filter algorithm, which may be used with various different combinations of sensors, is a common approach to this problem. Through the development of effective motion models for a skid-steered, outdoor robot, we have implemented a particle filter which may be used to test the effectiveness of a variety of sensors. Having tested the algorithm with a combination of odometry and GPS, we will explore methods from computer vision, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for effectively incorporating video cameras as sensors. To this end, we have collected a data set of images mapped to locations on a variety of maps which vary in size and path complexity, something which will allow us to test both the efficacy and robustness of the methods we will explore.

\section{INTRODUCTION}
For an autonomous robot to operate effectively in its environment, it is necessary that it be able to track its location over time. More formally, \textbf{localization} may be defined as the task of determining a robot's \textbf{pose}, which is in the form $(x~y~\theta)^T$, within a given map $M$. Although, simple to define, this task is made difficult by the inherently noisy nature of sensors. Even if a particular sensor's error is small, the dependence of each reading on the previous ones can quickly give rise to large systematic errors.  
\par
In order to combat this problem, localization algorithms often require and are greatly aided by the use of multiple sensors. By getting location estimates from a variety of sources, a tighter probability distribution for a robot's pose may be computed, allowing the error and uncertainty in pose estimates to be mitigated. 
\par
In this paper we detail the implementation of a \textbf{particle filter}, a popular localization algorithm, for use with the Jackal, a skid-steered, outdoor robot developed by ClearPath Robotics\footnote{https://www.clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-small-unmanned-ground-vehicle/}. To this end, we derive a motion model for the robot and employ the use of GPS sensors as well as its internal odometry for our implementation.
\par 
This work also explores how cameras may be used as sensors for localization. In order to map images to pose estimates, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract high-level feature vectors from images, which are then experimented with using a variety of different classification algorithms. 

\section{Background}
\subsection{Localization}
The task of any localization algorithm is to determine a likely estimate for a robot's current pose $(x~y~\theta)^T$. In order to accomplish this, the algorithm must work effectively with readings from its ensemble of sensors. 
\par
At each timestep $t$, a robot receives a \textbf{control} $u_t$, and a \textbf{sensor reading} $z_t$. The control is an estimate of the robot's translation and rotation since the last timestep as given by its internal sensors, such as odometry and IMU (inertial measurement unit), and is of the form $(\Delta x~\Delta y~\Delta \theta)^T$. Similarly, the sensor readings come from sensors external to the robot, such as GPS or laser range finders, and give a pose estimate of the form $(x_z~y_z~\theta _z)^T$. 
\par 
Using these readings, the robot's most likely pose $\textbf{x}_t=(x_t~y_t~\theta _t)^T$ may be found using the following formula: 
$$
\textbf{x}_t = argmax_{\textbf{x}}~P(\textbf{x}|\textbf{x}_{0:t-1}, u_{0:t}, z_{0:t})
$$
Given that the space of possible poses is continuous, however, makes the task of searching through it intractable. Further, the cost of computing such a function can quickly grow too large because of the dependence of the estimate on all previous estimates and readings. 
\par
In order to combat the growth of the cost, the \textbf{Markov assumption} may be used, allowing us to compute an estimate using only the current timestep's readings and the previous timestep's pose estimate:
$$
\textbf{x}_t = argmax_{\textbf{x}}~P(\textbf{x}|\textbf{x}_t-1, u_t, z_t)
$$
For working tractably in a continuous space, localization algorithms use a variety of sampling methods in order to approximate this function. 

\subsection{Particle Filters}

The approach of the particle filter algorithm to the problem of tractability is to use a discrete set of $N$ random variables known as \textbf{particles}. At each time step, particles are assigned different pose estimates based on the robot's models. This distribution of particles is then used in order to approximate the true probability distribution of the robot's pose. 
\par
To accomplish this, the algorithm iterates through three main procedures at each timestep. Firstly, each particle's pose estimate is computed using its previous pose and the current control readings in the \textit{elapse time} step. Following this, the \textit{weighing} step uses the current sensor reading in order to assign weights to each particle's estimate. Finally, in the \textit{resampling} step, a probability distribution of possible poses is computed based on the particle' poses and weights. 

\subsubsection{Elapse Time}
At each time step $t$ the robot's motion model is used in conjunction with the current control reading $u_t$ in order to derive a new pose for each particle:
$$
motion~model~update
$$
\subsubsection{Weigh}
Immediately after receiving a pose estimate, each particle is assigned a weight based on the current sensor model reading $z_t$. In order to effectively use GPS for localization, the latitudinal and longitudinal variances, $\sigma _{lon}^2$ and $\sigma _{lat}^2$ for the Jackal's GPS were approximated experimentally by collecting readings from a set of three marked places five different times. Using these values, the following loss function was derived:
$$
f(x)=loss~function
$$
This function was then used in order to assign a weight to each particle:
$$
w_t=f(\textbf{x}_t)
$$
\subsubsection{Resample} 
Using each particle's weights, a discrete probability density function is built, modelling the probability of each of the $N$ particle pose estimates: 
$$
Pdf~function
$$
Each particle's pose estimate is then re-sampled from this distribution.

\section{Data Set}


Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a separate text file. Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been formatted and styled. Do not use hard tabs, and limit use of hard returns to only one return at the end of a paragraph. Do not add any kind of pagination anywhere in the paper. Do not number text heads-the template will do that for you.

Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar:

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms} Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, sc, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

\subsection{Units}

\begin{itemize}

\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as Ò3.5-inch disk driveÓ.
\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ÒWb/m2Ó or Òwebers per square meterÓ, not Òwebers/m2Ó.  Spell out units when they appear in text: Ò. . . a few henriesÓ, not Ò. . . a few HÓ.
\item Use a zero before decimal points: Ò0.25Ó, not Ò.25Ó. Use Òcm3Ó, not ÒccÓ. (bullet list)

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Equations}

The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font (please no other font). To create multileveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled. Number equations consecutively. Equation numbers, within parentheses, are to position flush right, as in (1), using a right tab stop. To make your equations more compact, you may use the solidus ( / ), the exp function, or appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a sentence, as in

$$
\alpha + \beta = \chi \eqno{(1)}
$$

Note that the equation is centered using a center tab stop. Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following the equation. Use Ò(1)Ó, not ÒEq. (1)Ó or Òequation (1)Ó, except at the beginning of a sentence: ÒEquation (1) is . . .Ó

\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}
\begin{itemize}


\item The word ÒdataÓ is plural, not singular.
\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum ?0, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ÒoÓ.
\item In American English, commas, semi-/colons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
\item A graph within a graph is an ÒinsetÓ, not an ÒinsertÓ. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ÒalternatelyÓ (unless you really mean something that alternates).
\item Do not use the word ÒessentiallyÓ to mean ÒapproximatelyÓ or ÒeffectivelyÓ.
\item In your paper title, if the words Òthat usesÓ can accurately replace the word ÒusingÓ, capitalize the ÒuÓ; if not, keep using lower-cased.
\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ÒaffectÓ and ÒeffectÓ, ÒcomplementÓ and ÒcomplimentÓ, ÒdiscreetÓ and ÒdiscreteÓ, ÒprincipalÓ and ÒprincipleÓ.
\item Do not confuse ÒimplyÓ and ÒinferÓ.
\item The prefix ÒnonÓ is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
\item There is no period after the ÒetÓ in the Latin abbreviation Òet al.Ó.
\item The abbreviation Òi.e.Ó means Òthat isÓ, and the abbreviation Òe.g.Ó means Òfor exampleÓ.

\end{itemize}


\section{USING THE TEMPLATE}

Use this sample document as your LaTeX source file to create your document. Save this file as {\bf root.tex}. You have to make sure to use the cls file that came with this distribution. If you use a different style file, you cannot expect to get required margins. Note also that when you are creating your out PDF file, the source file is only part of the equation. {\it Your \TeX\ $\rightarrow$ PDF filter determines the output file size. Even if you make all the specifications to output a letter file in the source - if your filter is set to produce A4, you will only get A4 output. }

It is impossible to account for all possible situation, one would encounter using \TeX. If you are using multiple \TeX\ files you must make sure that the ``MAIN`` source file is called root.tex - this is particularly important if your conference is using PaperPlaza's built in \TeX\ to PDF conversion tool.

\subsection{Headings, etc}

Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads should be introduced. Styles named ÒHeading 1Ó, ÒHeading 2Ó, ÒHeading 3Ó, and ÒHeading 4Ó are prescribed.

\subsection{Figures and Tables}

Positioning Figures and Tables: Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation ÒFig. 1Ó, even at the beginning of a sentence.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{An Example of a Table}
\label{table_example}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
\hline
One & Two\\
\hline
Three & Four\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}


   \begin{figure}[thpb]
      \centering
      \framebox{\parbox{3in}{We suggest that you use a text box to insert a graphic (which is ideally a 300 dpi TIFF or EPS file, with all fonts embedded) because, in an document, this method is somewhat more stable than directly inserting a picture.
}}
      %\includegraphics[scale=1.0]{figurefile}
      \caption{Inductance of oscillation winding on amorphous
       magnetic core versus DC bias magnetic field}
      \label{figurelabel}
   \end{figure}
   

Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity ÒMagnetizationÓ, or ÒMagnetization, MÓ, not just ÒMÓ. If including units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only with units. In the example, write ÒMagnetization (A/m)Ó or ÒMagnetization {A[m(1)]}Ó, not just ÒA/mÓ. Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write ÒTemperature (K)Ó, not ÒTemperature/K.Ó

\section{CONCLUSIONS}

A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest applications and extensions.
